# Book-Genre-Clasifer
Have you ever tried to guess the genre of a book by reading its title? Well, in this project, I was trying to do it using a massive database of Books (their titles and genres), MLLib Spark, and the use of three different ML models, including:

**1- Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

**2- Logistic Regression**

**3- Neural Networks**
