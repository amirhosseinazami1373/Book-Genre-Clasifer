# Book-Genre-Clasifer
Have you ever tried to guess the genre of a book by reading its title? Well, in this project, I was trying to do it using a massive database of Books (their titles and genres), MLLib Spark, and the use of three different ML models, including:

1- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

2- Logistic Regression

3- Neural Networks
